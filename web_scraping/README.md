# Web Scraping

We use this book: <cite>Web Scraping with Python: Collecting Data from the Modern Web</cite>, by Ryan Mitchell (Oâ€™Reilly, 2015). A new 2nd edition of this will be published in 2018 but is not yet available, so we must use the 1st edition.

Python3 is used throughout this book.

## Setup for BeautifulSoup

**BeautifulSoup** is a scraping library for Python. We want to run all our scraping projects in a virtual environment. Students have already installed both Python3 and virtualenv.

* [Install Python3, virtualenv, Jupyter](http://bit.ly/install-python3-jupyter)

### Create a directory and change into it

The first step is to create a new folder (directory) for all your scraping projects. Mine is:

```bash
Documents/python/scraping
```

Do not use any spaces in your folder names. If you must use punctuation, do not use anything other than an underscore (\_).

**Change into that directory.** For me, the command would be:

```bash
cd Documents/python/scraping
```

### Create a new virtualenv in that directory and activate it

Create a new **virtualenv** there (this is done only once).

**Mac OS**
```bash
$ virtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python3 env
```

**Windows**
```bash
PS> virtualenv --python=C:\Python36\python.exe env
```

Activate the **virtualenv**:

**Mac OS**
```bash
$ source env/bin/activate
```

**Windows**
```bash
PS> env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**Important:** You should now see `(env)` at the far left side of your prompt. This indicates that the **virtualenv** is active.

### Install the BeautifulSoup library

In Mac OS or Windows, at the bash prompt (`$` Mac or `PS>` Windows), type:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

This is how you install *any* Python library that exists in the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). Pretty handy. **pip** is a tool for installing Python packages, which is what you just did.

**Note:** You installed BeautifulSoup in the Python3 **virtualenv** that is currently active. When that **virtualenv** is *not* active, BeautifulSoup will not be available to you. This is ideal, because you will create different virtual environments for different Python projects, and you won't need to worry about updated libraries in the future breaking your (past) code.

### Test beautifulsoup4

**Start Python3.** You should now be at the `>>>` prompt &mdash; the Python prompt.

In Mac OS or Windows, at the Python prompt (`>>>`), type one line at a time:

```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
html = urlopen("http://www.pythonscraping.com/exercises/exercise1.html")
bsObj = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
print(bsObj.h1)
```

1. You imported two Python modules, `urlopen` and `BeautifulSoup`.
2. You used `urlopen` to copy the entire contents of the URL given into a new Python variable, `html`.
3. You used `BeautifulSoup` to process the value of that variable (the contents of the file at that URL) through a built-in HTML parser (`html.parser` is not the only option for this).
4. Using the syntax of the BeautifulSoup library, you printed the first H1 element (including its tags) from that parsed value.

The example comes from page 8 of Mitchell's book; the code is updated in her [GitHub repo](https://github.com/REMitchell/python-scraping) for the book, where we can find updated code that will no doubt appear in her 2nd edition.
