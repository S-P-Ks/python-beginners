# Python Beginners

Used in conjunction with the book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/), by Al Sweigart (2015).

Since 2012, I have been teaching Python to journalism students. I used to use a set of tutorials called *Learn Python the Hard Way*. I’ve been trying to find a new set of instructions suitable for my students, whose previous experience with programming is recent and limited to client-side JavaScript.

In 2017 I adopted Sweigart’s text. I’m really pleased with the way he introduces the basics of Python 3. I decided to abandon Python 2 in mid-2017, and it’s great to have found a beginner text that explains enough but not too much.
