# Python Beginners

Used in conjunction with the book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/), by Al Sweigart (2015). There is a link to download his code under "Additional Content" on that page.

Since 2012, I have been teaching Python to journalism students. I used to use a set of tutorials called *Learn Python the Hard Way*. I’ve been trying to find a new set of instructions suitable for my students, whose previous experience with programming is recent and limited to client-side JavaScript.

I adopted Sweigart’s text in 2017. I’m really pleased with the way he introduces the basics of Python 3. I decided to abandon Python 2 in mid-2017, and it’s great to have found a beginner text that explains enough but not too much. I love Sweigart’s style and his examples.

The one thing I dislike in Sweigart’s book is his assumption that we would be using IDLE. We write our code in [Atom](https://atom.io/) and run it in Terminal (or PowerShell on Windows).

## One-time how-to documents

* [Command Line Tips](http://bit.ly/mm-commandline) &mdash; How to navigate among your files and folders in the Terminal.
* [Getting Started with Python 3](http://bit.ly/py3-quick-install) &mdash; How to install Python 3 and get it running.

## Week 01

Students read chapters 1 and 2 in Sweigart. Some scripts in the **week01** folder are based on Sweigart’s &mdash; naturally, he has more examples than only these. See the README in the **week01** folder for more information.

## Week 02

Students read chapter 3 in Sweigart. See the README in the **week02** folder for more information.

Writing modular code is not only a good practice; it also helps you to write functions you can test reliably and reuse in future work. See **modular-code** in the **week02** folder for more information.

## Week 03

Students read chapters 4 and 8 in Sweigart. See the README in the **week03** folder for more information.

Chapter 4 covers just about everything one needs to know about Python lists. The README highlights some of the methods, etc., we will use most often.

Chapter 8 covers reading and writing files with Python. The information we need most often is on pages 180-183. There are a couple of things not covered that I have explained in the README.

## Jupyter Cheat Sheet

Students use Jupyter Notebook to complete several assignments. The cheat sheet is helpful after Jupyter Notebook has been installed and they need to launch it, save their work, and close it correctly.

## Web scraping

Students are introduced to web scraping with the BeautifulSoup library in the second week. See the README in the **web_scraping** folder for instructions to install BeautifulSoup.

### Mitchell, chapter 3

The README in the [mitchell-ch3](https://github.com/macloo/python-beginners/tree/master/web_scraping/mitchell-ch3) folder supplements chapter 3 in *Web Scraping with Python*, by Ryan Mitchell. The chapter is very challenging for beginners, so here are a couple of `.py` files and examples to ease the way.
