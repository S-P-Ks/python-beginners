# Python Beginners

Used in conjunction with the book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/), by Al Sweigart (2015).

Since 2012, I have been teaching Python to journalism students. I used to use a set of tutorials called *Learn Python the Hard Way*. I’ve been trying to find a new set of instructions suitable for my students, whose previous experience with programming is recent and limited to client-side JavaScript.

I adopted Sweigart’s text in 2017. I’m really pleased with the way he introduces the basics of Python 3. I decided to abandon Python 2 in mid-2017, and it’s great to have found a beginner text that explains enough but not too much. I love Sweigart’s style and his examples.

The one thing I dislike in Sweigart’s book is his assumption that we would be using IDLE. We write our code in [Atom](https://atom.io/) and run it in Terminal (or PowerShell on Windows).

## Week 01

Students read chapters 1 and 2 in Sweigart. Some scripts in the **week01** folder are based on Sweigart’s &mdash; naturally, he has more examples than only these.

## Week 02

To come.
