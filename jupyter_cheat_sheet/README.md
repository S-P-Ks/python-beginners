# Jupyter Cheat Sheet

We use [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) for several assignments with Python. This app allows us to write, test and store Python code in one interactive file that opens in a web browser.

We installed Jupyter in a Python virtual environment using these instructions:

[Install Python3, virtualenv, Jupyter](http://bit.ly/install-python3-jupyter)

We created the *virtualenv* in a folder named `jupyter_work` and installed Jupyter there.

All of that is done ONLY ONCE.

## To launch Jupyter Notebook

`cd` into the folder (e.g. `jupyter_work`) where you set that up.

**Activate** the *virtualenv* (at the bash prompt):

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Start Jupyter Notebook (at the bash prompt):

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Everything else happens *in your web browser.* Choose the file you want to open from the list there. If the file isn't there yet, you can use the Mac Finder to drag it into the folder in the usual way (or Windows).

## To quit Jupyter Notebook

This is a two-step process. First you need to save and close your work in the web browser.

* To save your work, Command-S.
* To save and exit from the notebook, open the Jupyter **File** menu and select "Close and Halt."
* Click LOGOUT in the upper right corner.

Then, in the Terminal, press **Control-C** &mdash; NOT Command.

Still in Terminal â€” type `y` (lowercase) and press Enter/Return.

## Quit from your virtual environment

**Deactivate** the *virtualenv* (at the bash prompt):

```bash
deactivate
```
