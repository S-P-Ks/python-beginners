# Week 04: Python dictionaries; regex in Python

It's a bit of a lie to call this “Week 4,” because we are spending so much time on [new things](https://github.com/macloo/python-beginners/tree/master/web_scraping/more-from-mitchell) for web scraping in the fourth week, we don’t have time to talk about new Python concepts.

For now, I’ll just post the slide deck I built when I thought we could cover Sweigart’s chapters 5 and 7 this week.

* Chapter 5: Dictionaries and Structuring Data
* Chapter 7: Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions
