# Part 4: Forms in Flask

Flask has an extension that makes it easy to create web forms.

WTForms is “a flexible forms validation and rendering library for Python Web development.” With Flask-WTF, we get WTForms in Flask.

* WTForms includes security features for submitting form data.
* WTForms has built-in validation techniques.
* WTForms can be combined with Bootstrap to help us make clean-looking, responsive forms for mobile and desktop screens.

## Setup for using forms in Flask

We will install the **Flask-WTF** extension to help us work with forms in Flask. There are many extensions for Flask, and each one adds a different set of functions and capabilities. See the [list of Flask extensions](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/) for more.

In Terminal, change into your Flask projects folder and activate your virtualenv there. Then install at the bash prompt (`$`):

```bash
pip3 install Flask-WTF
```

We will also install the **Flask-Bootstrap** extension to provide Bootstrap styles for our forms.

```bash
pip3 install Flask-Bootstrap4
```

This installation is done only once in any virtualenv. It is assumed you already have Flask installed here.

* [Flask-WTF docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/wtforms/); more details in [WTForms docs](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Flask-Bootstrap docs](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/)

## Imports for forms with Flask-WTF and Flask-Bootstrap

You will have a long list of imports at the top of your Flask app file:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, url_for
from flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, SubmitField
from wtforms.validators import Required
```

Note as always that Python is case-sensitive, so upper- and lowercase must be used exactly as shown. The fourth line will change depending on **your form's contents.** For example, if you have a SELECT element, you'll need to import that. [See the complete list](WTForms-field-types.csv) of WTForms form field types.

## Set up a form in a Flask app

After the imports, these lines follow in the app script:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)

# Flask-WTF requires an encryption key - the string can be anything
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'C2HWGVoMGfNTBsrYQg8EcMrdTimkZfAb'

# Flask-Bootstrap requires this line
Bootstrap(app)
```

Flask allows us to set a "secret key" value. You can grab a string from a site such as [RandomKeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/). This value is used to prevent malicious hijacking of your form from an outside submission.

Flask-WTF's `FlaskForm` will automatically create a secure session with CSRF (cross-site request forgery) protection if this key-value is set. **Don't publish the actual key on GitHub!**

You can read more about `app.config['SECRET_KEY']` in [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22463939/demystify-flask-app-secret-key).

### Configure the form

Next, we configure a form that inherits from Flask-WTF's `FlaskForm`. Python style dictates that a class starts with an uppercase letter and uses camel case, so here our new class is `NameForm`.

In the class, we assign each form control to a unique variable. This form has only one text input field and one submit button.

**Every form control** must be configured here.

```python
class NameForm(FlaskForm):
    name = StringField('Which actor is your favorite?', validators=[Required()])
    submit = SubmitField('Submit')
```

[Learn more about classes in Python here.](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-first-look-at-classes)

Note that `StringField` and `SubmitField` were **imported** at the top of the file. If we needed other form fields in this form, we would need to import those also. See a [list of all WTForms field types](WTForms-field-types.csv).

Note that several field types (such as `RadioField` and `SelectField`) must have an option `choices=[]` specified, after the label text. Within the list, each choice is a pair in this format: `('string1', 'string2')`.

WTForms also has a long list of [validators](WTForms-validators.csv) we can use. The `Required()` validator prevents the form from being submitted if that field is empty. Note that these validators must also be imported at the top of the file.

### Put the form in a route function

Now we will use the form in a Flask route:

```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    names = get_names(ACTORS)
    # ACTORS is a list of dictionaries for 100 movie actors, imported with -
    # from data import ACTORS
    form = NameForm()
    # 'form' is the variable name used in this template: index.html
    # NameForm() is the class, explained above
    message = ""
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        name = form.name.data
        # get the text (data) out of the form control with the name "name"
        if name in names:
            # empty the form field
            form.name.data = ""
            id = get_id(ACTORS, name)
            # redirect the browser to another route and template
            return redirect( url_for('actor', id=id) )
        else:
            message = "That actor is not in our database."
    return render_template('index.html', names=names, form=form, message=message)
```

A crucial line is where we assign our configured form object to a new variable:

```python
form = NameForm()
```

### Put the form in a template

Before we break all that down and explain it, let's look at the code in the template *index.html*:

```html
{% extends 'bootstrap/base.html' %}
{% import "bootstrap/wtf.html" as wtf %}

{% block content %}

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">

      <h1>Welcome to the best movie actors Flask example!</h1>

      <p class="lead">This is the index page for an example Flask app using Bootstrap and WTForms.</p>

      {{ wtf.quick_form(form) }}

      <p class="space-above"><strong>{{ message }}</strong></p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

{% endblock %}
```

**Where is the form?** This is the amazing thing about Flask-WTF &mdash; by configuring the form as we did *in the Flask app,* we can generate a form with Bootstrap styles using nothing more than the template you see above.

<img src="../images/rabbit_hat.png" alt="Drawing of magician pulling rabbit from hat">

Note that in the Flask route function, we passed the variable `form` to the template *index.html*:

```python
return render_template('index.html', names=names, form=form, message=message)
```

So when you use `wtf.quick_form()`, the argument inside the parentheses must be the *variable* that represents the form you created in the app.

```python
form = NameForm()
```

We discussed the configuration of `NameForm` above.

### A quick note about Bootstrap in Flask

There's more about this in the [Resources section](#resources) at the bottom of this README &mdash; but to summarize briefly:

* You pip-installed Flask-Bootstrap4 in your Flask virtualenv.
* You wrote `from flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap` at the top of the Flask app file.
* Below that, you wrote `Bootstrap(app)` in the Flask app file.
* In any Flask template using Bootstrap styles in this app, the top line will be: `{% extends 'bootstrap/base.html' %}`

There's [an excellent how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE9ZGniSDW8) about using Bootstrap styles in Flask if you want to separate the **forms** information from the Bootstrap information in your mind. You can, of course, use Flask-Bootstrap4 *without* the forms!

## Examining the route function

Before reading further, try out [a working version of this app](https://weimergeeks.com/flask_form/). The complete code for the app is in this repo in the folder *actors_app*.

1. You type an actor's name into the form and submit it.
2. If the actor's name is in the data source (ACTORS), the app loads a detail page for that actor. (Photos of bears stand in for real photos of the actors.)
3. Otherwise, you stay on the same page, the form is cleared, and a message tells you that actor is not in the database.

```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    names = get_names(ACTORS)
    # you must tell the variable 'form' what you named the class, above
    # 'form' is the variable name used in this template: index.html
    form = NameForm()
    message = ""
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        name = form.name.data
        if name in names:
            # empty the form field
            form.name.data = ""
            id = get_id(ACTORS, name)
            # redirect the browser to another route and template
            return redirect( url_for('actor', id=id) )
        else:
            message = "That actor is not in our database."
    return render_template('index.html', names=names, form=form, message=message)
```

First we have the route, as usual, but with a new addition for handling form data: `methods`.

```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
```

Every HTML form has two possible methods, `GET` and `POST`. `GET` simply requests a response from the server. `POST`, however, sends a request **with data attached** in the body of the request; this is the way most forms are submitted.

This route needs to use both methods because when we simply open the page, no form was submitted, and we're opening it with `GET`. When we submit the form, this same page is opened with `POST` if the actor's name (the form data) was not found.

```python
def index():
    names = get_names(ACTORS)
```

At the start of the route function, we get the data source for this app. It happens to be in a list named `ACTORS`, and we get just the names by running a function, `get_names()`.

```python
form = NameForm()
message = ""
```

We assign the previously configured form object, `NameForm()`, to a new variable, `form`.

We create a new, empty variable, `message`.

```python
if form.validate_on_submit():
    name = form.name.data
```

`validate_on_submit()` is a built-in WTForms function, called on `form` (our variable). **If it returns True,** the following commands and statements in the block will run. If not, the form is simply not submitted, and invalid fields are flagged. It will return True if the form was filled in and submitted.

`form.name.data` is the contents of the text input field represented by `name`. Perhaps we should review how we configured the form:

```python
class NameForm(FlaskForm):
    name = StringField('Which actor is your favorite?', validators=[Required()])
    submit = SubmitField('Submit')
```

That `name` is the `name` in `form.name.data` &mdash; the contents of which we will now store in a new variable, `name`. To put it another way: `name` now contains whatever the user typed into the text input field.

```python
if name in names:
    # empty the form field
    form.name.data = ""
    id = get_id(ACTORS, name)
    # redirect the browser to another route and template
    return redirect( url_for('actor', id=id) )
else:
    message = "That actor is not in our database."
```

This if-statement is specific to this app. It checks whether the `name` (that was typed into the form) matches any name in the list `names`. If not, we jump down to `else` and text is put into the variable `message`. If `name` DOES match, we clear out the form, run a function called `get_id()`, and &mdash; **important!** &mdash; open a *different route* in this app:

```python
return redirect( url_for('actor', id=id) )
```

Thus `redirect( url_for('actor', id=id) )` is calling a different route here in the same Flask app script. [See lines 46-55 here.](actors_app/actors.py)

As far as **using forms with Flask** is concerned, you don't need to worry about the actors and their ids, etc. What is important is that the route function can be used to *evaluate the data sent from the form.* We check to see whether it matched any of the actors in a list, and *a different response* will be sent based on match or no match.

You could do *any* of the things that are typically done with HTML forms &mdash; handle usernames and passwords, write new data to a database, create a quiz, etc.

The final line in the route function calls the template *index.html* and passes three variables to it:

```python
return render_template('index.html', names=names, form=form, message=message)
```

## Conclusion

**Flask-WTF** provides convenient methods for working with forms in Flask. Forms can be built easily and also processed easily, with a minimum of code.

Adding **Flask-Bootstrap** ensures that we can build mobile-friendly forms with a minimum amount of effort.

Note that it is possible to build a customized form layout using Bootstrap 4 styles in a Flask template, or to build a custom form with no Bootstrap styles. In either case, you cannot use `{{ wtf.quick_form(form) }}` but would instead write out all the form code in your Flask template as you would in a normal HTML file. To take advantage of WTForms, you would still  create the form class with `FlaskForm` in the same way as shown above.

**IMPORTANT:** Note that you are using Bootstrap 4 if you installed with `pip3 install Flask-Bootstrap4`. In early 2018, Bootstrap 4 replaced Bootstrap 3. The differences are significant; names and usage of styles have changed. Refer to the [Bootstrap 4 documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/) for correct usage of Bootstrap styles.
