# Example 1 app

This Flask app, using templates, is explained in the README in [flask/part3_templates](../).

To run it (assuming you are in a Python 3 virtualenv with Flask installed):

```bash
python students2.py
```

Note, `students1.py` is a version of this *without* templates. The HTML is written out in each of the route functions (awkward).
