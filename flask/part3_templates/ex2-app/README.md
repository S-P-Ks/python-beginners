# Example 2 app: Use of a base template file

This app differs from the Example 1 app in only one respect: It uses a base template (in the *templates* folder), allowing the two other templates (*index.html* and *student.html*) to be very short, relying on the HTML in *base.html*.

This Flask app, using templates, is explained in the README in [flask/part3_templates](../).

To run it (assuming you have Flask installed):

```bash
python students2.py
```
