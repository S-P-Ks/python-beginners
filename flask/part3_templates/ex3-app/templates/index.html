<h1>Welcome to the student records Flask example!</h1>

<p>Click any student's last name.</p>

    <ul>
    {% for item in student_list %}
        <li><a href="student/{{ item[0] }}">{{ item[1] }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

<!-- Note that student_list was sent to this template by a route.
     The route called a function that created an alphabetical list by
     student last name.
     The list is a list of tuples, in which thing[0] is the student ID
     and thing[1] is the lastname.
     Jinja2 lets us write Python between specialized tags like PHP.
     - for item in student_list - it is a normal for-loop.
